Create a TypeScript program that models a simple quiz with true/false questions.
Use an array of questions objects "questions" to store: category, question, correctAnswer
the categories could be: GeneralKnowledge, Science, Math, Programming
then create a checkAnswer function that will accept a question and the user answer and will return if it is correct
use it like: checkAnswer(questions[0], false);
console.log(`Your answer is:`, checkAnswer(questions[1], true));
