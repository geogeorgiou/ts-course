// Exclude

// The 'Exclude' utility type in TypeScript is used to create a type
// by excluding specific types from a union type.
// Useful when we want to filter out certain types from a broader set of types.

//the difference from Omit is that its used in unions instead of object types

// Syntax: Exclude<Type, ExcludedUnion>

namespace Exclude {
  type Animal = 'Dog' | 'Cat' | 'Bird' | 'Fish';
  type DomesticAnimal = Exclude<Animal, 'Bird' | 'Fish'>;

  const myPet: DomesticAnimal = 'Dog';
  // In this example, the 'Bird' and 'Fish' types are excluded from the 'DomesticAnimal' type.
}
