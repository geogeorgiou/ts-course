Write a TypeScript program that creates a class called Student with properties name and roll number.

Add constructor to support multiple ways of initializing a Student object.
Implement one constructor that takes both name and roll number as parameters.
The two properties should be private.

Create an object (student1) and print it's properties.

Create a second object (student2) give as name "Edward Dodd" and rollNumber "10".
Try to change the rollNumber to 5 and print it

Exercise 2 Inheritance

The property color should not be public!

This program prints a message indicating that the shape is being drawn.

Then, create a derived class Circle that extends Shape.
Override the draw() method in the Circle class to provide a specific implementation for drawing a circle.
