// TypeScript Interface Exercise

// Task 1: Define a basic Interface
// Create an interface named 'IStudent' that should have the following properties:
// - 'studentId' of type number
// - 'fullName' of type string
// This interface represents the basic structure of a student object.

// Task 2: Extend the Interface
// Extend the 'IStudent' interface to create a new interface named 'IUniStudent'.
// Add the following to 'IUniStudent':
// - an optional property named 'isEnrolled' of type boolean.
// - a readonly property named 'university' of type string.

// Task 3: Function Type in Interface for Simple Calculation
// Add a method signature to the 'IUniStudent' interface.
// The method, named 'getYearsStudied', should accept an enrollment year and return the number of years studied.

// Task 4: Create an object using the extended Interface
// Create a 'uniStudent' object that implements the extended interface.
// Provide values for all the properties, including the inherited ones from 'IStudent'.

// Task 5: Invoke the Interface Function
// Use the 'getYearsStudied' method on the 'uniStudent' object.
// Pass an enrollment year to the method and output the number of years studied.
